An experienced solidity developer with expertise in understanding and delivering software solutions based on business requirements.

My interest lies in NFTs, Marketplaces, Decentralised Finance and Blockchain development in general.

I am an expert in Solidity for smart contract development and have been actively doing smart contract auditing which also helps me to write optimized and secure contracts.

I have deep knowledge around the various token standards like ERC1155, ERC721, ERC20 and I have working experience with standards like EIP4626, EIP5095, EIP2771 and EIP712 for metatransactions.

I have been writing upgradeable contracts for a long time and have specific knowledge in that area. I have been using Transparent proxies, Beacon proxies and UUPS proxies.

I have enough experience with sidechains and other layer 2 technologies like polygon and arbitrum.

I have also implemented diamond proxies(EIP2535) to eliminate the size limit on a solidity contract.

When it comes to Full stack web development, I have worked in backend technologies like Node.js and ROR.

My expertise lies in frontend technologies with React.js.
